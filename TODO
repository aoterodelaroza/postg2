* psi4 has issues writing the molden file for some benzene rings,
   check the git version.   
* Generalize the reader with the new formula in gnorm
-- Order of the primitives in the common and apply it to 
   terachem, gaussian and other.   
* spherical to cartesian transformation. Check psi4/fchk.
* multiwfn... take a look at the code
* fix poisson's nl and nr... good nr and nl for all atoms (see numol)
* lmax/nwav correctly set
* improve poisson routine, parallelize
* improve exact exchange routine, parallelize
   
* what happens with een? (see numol)
  -- calculate 1-e integrals?
* occ(orbs) -> occ(orbs,spin)
* libxc spinpolarized in energy.f90
* other definitions of the grid
* RI and basis set fitting
* potential calculation at arbitrary points
* ECP contribution?
* B05
* B13
* Victor's trick
* Tao and other C6
